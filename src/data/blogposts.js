        <h3>4. Driving Modes</h3>
        
        <br />

        <p>
          There are three drive modes in a Huracan, all that offer distinct 
          characteristics in terms of performance, handling, and responsiveness. Here's a breakdown of each mode:
        </p>

        <h4>Strada:</h4>
        
        <p>
          Strada is the default driving mode and is designed for everyday road use and comfort. 
          In this mode, the car's suspension is set to its most comfortable setting, offering a smoother ride.
        </p>

        <h4>Sport:</h4>
        
        <p>
          Sport mode is a step up in terms of performance and engagement compared to Strada. 
          The suspension stiffens slightly, enhancing the car's responsiveness and improving handling during spirited driving. 
          The exhaust note also becomes more pronounced, emitting a sportier sound that enhances the driving soundtrack.
        </p>

        <h4>Corsa:</h4>
        
        <p>
          Corsa mode is a manual only mode that is the most aggressive and performance-focused setting available in a 
          Lamborghini Huracan. The suspension is further stiffened, providing maximum responsiveness and precise handling. 
          The exhaust system opens up fully, producing a loud and exhilarating sound that is characteristic of a Lamborghini.
